For the features of the SEIHR model, we adopt Monte Carlo simulations. The code is available in the file-Monte Carlo. The impact of different immunization strategies is available in files-Acquaintance, Active, and random immunization. Moreover, the code of optimal control strategies is shown in the file-control.
